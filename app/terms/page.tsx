      </p>

      <h2>5. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Website for any unlawful purpose.</li>
        <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Website or related systems.</li>

      <h2>6. Eligibility and Age Restriction</h2>
      <p>
        The Website may only be used by individuals who have reached the minimum
        age of digital consent in their jurisdiction. By using the Website, you
        represent and warrant that you meet this eligibility requirement.
      </p>

      <h2>7. No Emergency or Safety Service</h2>
      <p>
        The calculator provides an estimated distance based on the time between a
        lightning flash and thunder. It is not a substitute for emergency
        services, weather alerts, or professional meteorological advice. Do not
        rely on the Website for safety-critical decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Calculator Methodology; Assumptions and Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        (a) Methodology. The calculator utilizes a “seconds-to-sound”
        approximation to estimate distance from the time interval between
        lightning and thunder.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Assumptions. The approximation assumes typical atmospheric conditions
        and generalized average speeds of sound; actual conditions (temperature,
        humidity, altitude, wind, terrain) and human observation variance may
        materially affect results.
      </p>
      <p>
        (c) Limitations. The results are estimates only, are not precise
        measurements, and are unsuitable for professional, scientific,
        navigational, or safety-critical use. Device timing accuracy, delayed
        perception of sound, overlapping thunder events, and environmental noise
        may further reduce accuracy.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Content Disclaimer (Blog)</h2>
      <p>
        Blog articles are provided for general informational purposes only. They
        do not constitute meteorological, scientific, legal, or professional
        advice. You should verify information through official or trusted sources
        and exercise independent judgment.
      </p>

      <h2>10. No Professional Advice</h2>
      <p>
        Nothing on the Website constitutes certified weather, safety, emergency,
        or professional guidance. Users should follow official sources (including,
        without limitation, the National Weather Service (NWS), NOAA, and local
        emergency authorities).
      </p>

      <h2>11. Intellectual Property; Feedback</h2>
      <p>
        (a) Ownership. The Website and all Content are owned by us or our
        licensors and are protected by intellectual property and other laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        (b) Restrictions. Except as expressly permitted in these Terms, you may
        not reproduce, distribute, modify, publicly display, or create derivative
        works from the Website or Content.
      </p>
      <p>
